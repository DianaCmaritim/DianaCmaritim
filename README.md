## Hi, I'm Diana Maritim 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

<img src="github.png" alt="banner that says Diana Maritim - software engineer alongside a cartoon illustration of Diana">
I'm a software developer who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community.

Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup),Ruby frameworks Sinatra and Rails.<br>



**Fun Facts**

🌟  The first language I used to program "Hello World" was Javascript

🧁  I love me some sweet treats though I rarely bake

📚  I love RomCom movies and and I dig the Marvel Universe...I mean who doesn't?

✈️ Travel is a must do!I love adventure and exploring new places,but somehow rarely do

🌱 When I am not coding,farming is therapeutic for me
